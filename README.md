# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

   * # Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
* The objective of this project was to help Louise visualize the international success and failure of theater shows over the course of years. 

### Purpose

* The purpose of this project was to be able to analyze the financial impact of successful and failed theater projects can have on revenue. 
this project can be applied to a real life scenario to optimize decision making. 
## Analysis and Challenges
  ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
* As evident from the analysis of Theater Outcomes by Launch Date, a theater play was most successful if launched within the month of May. 
The success of a theater play waned as the months progressed, however in October and Feburary there was a spike in the success of theater plays.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

* I was unsuccessful in the collection and interpretation of data within the defined filters therefore I do not feel I can comment on the analysis of the Outcome Based on Goals. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

* One significant challenge that I encountered was that I could not configure a COUNTIFS formula that I was confidence in when I was creating my pivot table for Outcomes Based on Goals. For example when using the COUNTifs formula at first I had a much less complex formula, but upon re-reviewing the help video I came up with this formula =COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!$D:$D,">=1000", Kickstarter!$D:$D,"<=4999",Kickstarter!$R:$R,"plays") although I am not certain that the last criteria was really necessary.

Each time I attempted a new formula and filter on my data I was met with a different sum total for each column. 

## Results

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

* One conclusion I can draw from the Outcomes based on Launch Date data is that if Louise were to release another play in the month of May then it would be successful, more successful than if she realized that same play within a different month of the year.

* Another conclusion I can draw from the Outcomes based on Launch Date data is that the number of failed theater plays was in the month of October therefore, if a company released a production in October it would be plausible to assume it has a greater chance of failing. 

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

* I was unsuccessful in the collection and interpretation of data within the defined filters therefore I do not feel I can comment on the analysis of the Outcome Based on Goals.

What are some limitations of this dataset?

* The distinction or lack of inclusion of musicals within the filter of category was not a very clear distinction because a musical is largely considered a play if it is on Broadway or in a Theater setting.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

* We could have created another table and graph that further filtered based on specific country, for example, strictly Plays Debuted within the United States. 

* We could also create a table and graph that includes musicals within the filters because a musical can also be considered a play so that distincition was not very clear.
